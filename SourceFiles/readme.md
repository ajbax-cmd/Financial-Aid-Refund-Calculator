## General Info
This project is a simple refund calculator intended to be used by the financial aid department of a community college. The calculator will determine the amount a student is receiving for a refund as well which part of term they will receive their refund based on the user input.

The class files for refund calculations for Fall/Spring and Summer could potentially be incorporated into other projects as objects that get input directly from the student's accounts rather than a financial aid technician.

## Technologies
Project was created with:
* C++ 14
* Visual Studio 2019

## Setup
* After downloading the zip file, extract all contents to a location on your
device.

* Inside the folder named "Calculator" is the .exe file that will run the program. You can right click on this file, copy it, and paste to your desktop to create a shortcut.

* If using the class files for a seperate project, the class functions need to be called in the following order after the member variables have been assigned:<br>
 sort();<br>
 calculateDisb();<br>
 calculatePell();<br>
 calculateLoan();<br>
 calculateRefund();<br>
